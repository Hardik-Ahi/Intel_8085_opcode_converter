# Intel 8085 opcode converter

## What is it?

This program is an Intel 8085 mnemonics-to-opcode converter. It was written specifically for converting the mnemonics-based programs written on the website 'sim8085.com'
to the corresponding opcode version, so that if one has access to a working 8085 trainer kit, they can focus purely on the logic and flow of their programs without
needing to manually convert each instruction to opcode.

This program was developed primarily for aiding students in educational institutions who have been introduced to the 8085 microprocessor.
Some trainer kits have this unique 'feature' that if one makes an error while giving the mnemonic code to the processor, one has to start all over again.
The alternative route which can be used is to enter the opcode of each instruction at a specified memory location, and if we make an error doing so, we can
simply go back and edit that instruction without losing all our progress. But this requires us to first have the opcodes of all instructions ready.

Having to manually convert each instruction to opcode, by referencing a lengthy opcode sheet, to me is not such a fun task to do. Thus this program was written to
take care of the conversion.
